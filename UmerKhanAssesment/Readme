Dear Recuriter,

I hope this message finds you well.

I have successfully implemented two functionalities as required; however, I am encountering challenges with the implementation of the remaining three functionalities. Given that the internship focuses heavily on programming, I have dedicated significant effort to these tasks and was able to complete the initial implementations within one hour.

I would appreciate any guidance or assistance you can provide to help me address the current issues and ensure the remaining functionalities are implemented effectively.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,  
Umer Khan
